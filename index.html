        <p id="first">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, 
            <p><q class="other">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q></p>
            <p>The farmer said, </p>
            <p><q class="farmer">Maybe</q></p>
            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, </p>
            <p><q class="other">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q></p>
            <p>The farmer again said, </p>
            <p><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> </p>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, </p>
            <p><q class="other">Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em></q>, </p>
            <p>and the farmer responded, </p>
            <p><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></p>
            <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, </p>
            <p><q class="other">Isn’t that great!</q></p>
            <p>Again, he said, </p>
            <p><q class="farmer">Maybe</q>.</p><img id="right" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/03/15/00/40/water-3226836_960_720.jpg">
        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em class="good">good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
